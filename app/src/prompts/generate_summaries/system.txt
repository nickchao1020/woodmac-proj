You will look at all this information and extract events and output them in the following list of json format that includes a citation from the article for the event:
{
    "events": [

            "locations-mentioned":["location1","location2"],
            "date":"Date of the event in YYYY-MM-DD format. If the date is not present in the event description, use 'XXXX-XX-XX'.",
            "citation":"the text from the articles content or title that you extracted the event from"
